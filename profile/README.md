## 🌟 Overview

MailDefender is an **open-source**, **scalable**, and **modular** system designed to combat email spam by requiring first-time senders to validate their identity. Once validated, all pending messages are released, and future messages from the same sender are automatically delivered.

### Key Features
- **First-time Sender Validation**: Automatically sends a validation link to new contacts.
- **Pending Message Queue**: Temporarily holds messages from unvalidated senders.
- **Automatic Release**: Delivers all pending messages after successful validation.
- **Non-Proxy Add-On**: Acts as an add-on to your existing email infrastructure, ensuring all data remains within your ecosystem and is never routed through a third-party proxy.
- **Customizable Mail Sorting**: Automatically sorts emails based on user-defined rules, allowing for personalized inbox management.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Built with microservices for easy integration of new features (e.g., SPF verification, IP reputation checks).

|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Validator** | Entry point to validate token..                      |
| **Engine**     | MailDefender's hearth.       |
| **imap-connector**   | Expose IMAP function through an API.                      |
| **Notifier**       | Send emails and notifications.                |
